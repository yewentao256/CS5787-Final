\section*{Introduction}
This paper explores the relationship between image inpainting and outpainting by training a model capable of interpolating between two disparate images, blending them seamlessly into a single coherent scene. Inpainting, or image interpolation, is a computer vision task that aims to fill in missing or removed sections of an image, ensuring the completed area integrates smoothly with the existing content. Outpainting, or image extrapolation, generates extensions of an image beyond its original borders.

Drawing inspiration from both inpainting and outpainting, our objective is to generate a transitional region between two images. Traditional inpainting requires an understanding of the context and semantics surrounding the missing area to blend edges seamlessly into the original image. Outpainting, while sharing these challenges, has less context to infer from since it involves extending the image into an unknown space. Additionally, outpainting must handle long-range semantic dependencies, ensuring the generated extensions remain consistent with the original image no matter how far the extrapolation extends. Our task incorporates these challenges and introduces an added complexity: the need for the generated region to be semantically consistent with both images.

\section*{Related Work}
To address the challenges of our task, we leverage deep learning architectures capable of capturing both the semantics at the edges of each image and the relationships between regions across the two images. Historically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used in vision tasks due to their efficiency and ability to learn spatial relationships \cite{LeCun1998, Krizhevsky2012}. However, CNNs have inherent limitations stemming from their design. Their architecture emphasizes locality, with weight sharing across the entire input, which makes them less adept at capturing long-range dependencies or relationships between non-local regions—a key requirement for complex tasks like ours.

Transformer-based architectures, particularly those employing attention mechanisms, have shown effectiveness in both inpainting and outpainting due to their capacity to model long-range dependencies. For example, \cite{Jiahui2018} demonstrated that incorporating a contextual attention layer significantly improved inpainting performance. Vision Transformers (ViTs) introduced by \cite{Dosovitskiy2020} expanded on this by applying self-attention mechanisms to computer vision tasks, enabling the modeling of global relationships in an image. Further advancements, such as Swin Transformers \cite{Liu2021}, refined the transformer architecture for vision tasks using hierarchical computation and shifted windows to improve efficiency and adaptability. These approaches, however, remain computationally expensive and require large datasets for effective training \cite{Dascoli2021}.

Yang et al. (2019) proposed a U-net GAN architecture to perform very long outpainting of a scene in one direction. They used Skip Horizontal Connections to connect each layer of the encoder and decoder in the Unet and an LSTM-based Recurrent Transfer Network to transfer the encoded sequences to the decoder. Using this method and generating in multiple steps, they were able to demonstrate long outpainting. Lu et al. (2021) expanded on this work by combining inpainting, outpainting, and image blending to fill in a scene between two images horizontally. They introduced a similar U-net GAN architecture to Yang et al. but also incorporated contextual attention and a Bidirectional Content Transfer module, which used LSTMs as a bottleneck to ensure spatial and semantic consistency across two images. Our work generalizes this approach by extending it to painting between two images in multiple directions.

\section*{Datasets}
We used the \textcolor{red}{\href{https://github.com/z-x-yang/NS-Outpainting}{NS-Outpainting}} dataset to train our models. It is used in the original U-Transformer paper. We also tested our trained model on additional images sourced from the internet.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Architecture}
Our approach employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework that integrates a U-Net-based generator and a PatchGAN-based discriminator. We chose these architectures to effectively handle the challenges of our interpolation task. Specifically, the generator is responsible for synthesizing the transitional region between two input images, producing outputs that not only blend these images seamlessly but also remain contextually and semantically consistent. The discriminator, on the other hand, aims to distinguish real, fully integrated images from those generated by the model, thereby guiding the generator toward more authentic and coherent results.

\subsubsection*{Generator (U-Net)}
The generator in our framework is inspired by the U-Net architecture, originally proposed by Ronneberger et al. (2015). U-Net is known for its encoder-decoder structure with symmetric skip connections that allow spatial details lost in downsampling operations to be reintroduced at corresponding upsampling stages. This architectural feature is crucial for high-resolution image synthesis tasks, such as ours, because it helps preserve both low-level details (e.g., textures and edges) and high-level semantic cues that are essential for coherent blending. The U-Net generator consists of a series of downsampling convolutional layers that progressively capture increasingly abstract features. These encoder stages are followed by a bottleneck layer and a series of corresponding upsampling layers that reconstruct the image back to the original resolution. Skip connections transfer feature maps from the encoder to the decoder, ensuring that spatial and contextual information is retained throughout the synthesis process. The final layer of the generator uses a Tanh activation function to constrain the output pixels to the [-1, 1] range, consistent with our input normalization scheme. This U-Net variant has been successfully applied in tasks like inpainting and outpainting, thus making it a suitable choice for our image interpolation objective.

\subsubsection*{Discriminator (PatchGAN)}
Instead of a standard discriminator that outputs a single scalar probability for the entire image, we adopt a PatchGAN-based discriminator \cite{Isola2017}. The PatchGAN discriminator classifies overlapping local patches of the image as real or fake, rather than the entire image at once. This approach has shown effectiveness in encouraging finer local detail synthesis and prevents the generator from focusing solely on global consistency. By examining smaller regions independently, the PatchGAN discriminator ensures that textures, edges, and local structures are faithfully rendered, ultimately contributing to more realistic intermediate regions.

\subsection*{Training Procedure}
Our GAN is trained in an adversarial manner. The generator \( G \) takes as input a partially masked image that combines two cropped regions—one from the left-bottom portion of one scene and one from the right-top portion of another scene—thus producing a coherent output that fills in the missing portions. The discriminator \( D \) is trained to distinguish the ground-truth combined scene from the generated ones. Throughout training, \( G \) aims to produce outputs that are indistinguishable from real images, while \( D \) refines its ability to detect generated content, pushing \( G \) to create more realistic and semantically consistent results.

\subsection*{Loss Functions}
\textbf{Adversarial Loss:}

We employ a standard least-squares GAN objective for the adversarial training (Mao et al., 2017). For the discriminator, the loss compares real and fake patches, encouraging it to assign a high score to real imagery and a low score to generated content. The generator, conversely, seeks to produce patches that the discriminator deems real.

\textbf{Reconstruction Loss (L1 Loss):}

To ensure that the generated content closely matches the ground-truth target image in the masked regions, we use an L1 reconstruction loss:

\textbf{Structural Similarity (SSIM) Loss:}

While pixel-level losses help guide low-level detail, we also incorporate a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss to ensure perceptual quality and to maintain local image structures. The SSIM-based term computes how structurally similar the generated region is to the target, adding a complementary metric that focuses on luminance, contrast, and structural attributes

\textbf{Perceptual Loss:}

Inspired by style transfer and inpainting literature, we include a perceptual loss derived from pre-trained VGG-19 features (Johnson et al., 2016). This loss compares high-level representations of the generated and ground-truth images

\textbf{Combined Objective:}

The total generator loss is a weighted combination of these terms:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{G} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{GAN}}(G,D) + \lambda_{\text{recon}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}(G) + \lambda_{\text{SSIM}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSIM}}(G) + \lambda_{\text{perc}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{perc}}(G),
\]

\section*{Results}
To evaluate our model, we performed qualitative and quantitative experiments on both the NS-Outpainting dataset and additional custom images. Visual results demonstrate that our model successfully generates intermediate regions that are visually coherent and semantically consistent with the surrounding parts of the image.

Quantitative evaluation was performed using metrics like the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), where our model outperformed baseline methods in both metrics.

\section*{Conclusion}
In this report, we presented a method for performing image outpainting by interpolating between two scenes. We extended existing architectures such as U-Net and PatchGAN to create a model capable of generating intermediate regions that are both visually and semantically coherent. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in generating smooth transitions between two images, effectively handling the challenges of both inpainting and outpainting.
